* update the readme file

* get away from forcing the feedcache plugin directory to be called 'feedcache' - allow users to call it what they want and then just check for the base directory and path via PHP

* switch from using Ruby to using the built-in WP fetch_rss calls that use Magpie and caching

* make Feedity.com feeds work with plugin

* make the feed groups sortable by newest items.  If a feed has new items it should be "floated up" to the top of that group
